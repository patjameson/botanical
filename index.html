        <h3>Project Statement</h3>
        <p>The Buffalo Botanical Gardens is in need of a server migration in order to stabilize their current environment in the event of a system failure in one of the key components. Our solution to this problem is to migrate the cloud based services into a local server in order to ensure database functionality as well as eliminate the need for the current Linode server hosting. Doing so will also allow the Botanical Gardens to be in control of their extensive database entirely, easing transitions for future changes and upgrades.</p>

        <h3>Project Requirements Document</h3>
        <em>Introduction of Problem Statement</em>
        <p>The Buffalo Botanical Gardens is home to tens of thousands of plant species and information, being visited on a day-to-day basis by students, scholars, and the general public at large. This database requires a large investment in cloud based data, particularly for the entries themselves as well as all of the picture information as well. Currently, their server for hosting this database is located on a Linode cloud based server in New Jersey with their visual information hosted through Amazon Cloud Services.</p>
        <em>Background Research</em> 
        <p>The Botanical Gardens is a local operation with very limited technology and funding at its disposal. With the limitations placed upon their software and hardware availability, their database has needed to continue through cloud based operations set in place many years ago. This database is critical to the operations of the garden, with tens of thousands of plant species, fauna, names, and images for their respective breeds are utilized on a number of internet based platforms.</p>
        <p>In the event of one component somehow failing, the entire database will end up crashing as a result. Numerous activities would grind to a halt, seriously tarnishing the gardenâ€™s reputation as well as requiring the use of time and resources the Garden simply does not have in order to repair. The lack of reliability on operating with long-distance servers has led the Botanical Gardens to seek a means to rectify this issue. Numerous Botanical Gardens within the country have managed to relocate their databases to local servers and the Buffalo Botanical Garden seeks to follow suit with such an endeavor.</p>
        <em>Request of the Client</em>
        <p>The Buffalo Botanical Gardens seeks to localize their Amazon and Linode cloud based servers and data retrieval to a server more suited to their future goals and current needs. This would provide reliability and assurance that the critical components of their heavily utilized database could never be in jeopardy. The stabilization of their database is critical, and so localization with potential back-ups in the cloud based servers is required.</p>
